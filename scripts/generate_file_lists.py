"""
Simulates the file discovery and filtering logic of the Rust `ingest` command.
It recursively finds all files in a directory and then separates them into two lists
based on a name-based filter.

This is a diagnostic tool to identify exactly which files would be processed
versus which would be filtered out by the ingest command.

Outputs:
  - files_to_be_processed.txt
  - filtered_out_files.txt
