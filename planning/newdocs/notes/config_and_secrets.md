Configuration and Secrets: A note formalizing that the application is configured primarily through the database. Environment variables, managed by Doppler, are used only for bootstrapping and secrets (database connection URLs, Clerk API keys, etc.), not for business logic toggles. For initial development, using a local .env is fine, and we can add doppler to handle the complexity of the interacting parts and enhance security once we start preparing the implemented architecture for prod.
