Title: Sapflux agent index and source-of-truth map

Purpose

This short index helps coding agents find the right files fast, keep context small, and resolve conflicts between docs and code without needing frequent updates to this index.
When in doubt, trust the code and tests in crates/ over any planning document. Use planning docs only for intent and background.
Conflict resolution

If code/tests and docs disagree: code + tests are authoritative.
Use the latest progress report and latest code review for “what’s next” (see below). Otherwise, use the module map and tests to infer intended behavior.
How to find the latest status and review (auto-updating rule)

Latest progress report: open progress_report/statusX.md with the highest numeric X. Example pattern: status9.md is newer than status8.md.
Latest code review: open the file with the highest leading number in code_reviews/. Example: 3_gpt_5_thinking_high.md is newer than 2_gpt_5_thinking_high.md. Compare the leading integer only.
Minimal context set (what to load by default)

Code reviews come from an external source and Riley Leff will add them at his discretion.
Progress reports are generated by the implementing agent and are kept in the progress_report folder. You can generate one every time you make meaningful progress in the implementation.

Always include:
crates/** (all code and tests)
crates/sapflux-core/migrations/0001_init.sql
This file: planning/agent_index.md
Omit unless you are modifying them or need background:
planning/reference_implementations/**
code_reviews/** (read only the highest-numbered one when checking current feedback)
progress_report/** (read only the highest-numbered one when checking current status)
planning/writeups/** (optional; see “Planning docs map” below)
planning/notes/** (optional, topic-specific background)

Transaction orchestration and receipts

Integration test: crates/sapflux/tests/transactions.rs
Data flow overview (end-to-end)

POST /transactions
Advisory lock serializes execution.
Insert transactions row with outcome=PENDING (non-dry-run).
Ingestion: compute blake3, detect duplicates, parse via active parsers, gather per-file reports/attempts.
Batch pipeline on all successfully parsed files: flatten → timestamp_fixer → metadata_enricher → parameter_resolver → calculator → quality_filters.
Object-store upload-first for new raw files (idempotent; LocalDir now, S3/R2 later).
If pipeline OK and uploads OK: persist raw_files; update transaction outcome=ACCEPTED and store the receipt. Otherwise mark outcome=REJECTED with failure details.
Dry run: no DB writes; return full receipt.
Outputs (planned wiring)
Final dataframe → Parquet to outputs/{output_id}.parquet (upload-first).
Insert outputs row and flip all prior rows’ is_latest=false in the same DB tx.
Reproducibility cartridge to repro-cartridges/{output_id}.zip (upload-first), then update outputs row with cartridge path.
Download API returns pre-signed URL (or 302 redirect) for private R2.
Database quick facts

Schema: crates/sapflux-core/migrations/0001_init.sql
Transactions: immutable audit with outcome PENDING → ACCEPTED/REJECTED and stored receipt.
raw_files(file_hash) references the transaction that ingested it.
deployments and datalogger_aliases use exclusion constraints to prevent overlaps and adjacency.
outputs.is_latest: on insert of a new output, set it true and flip others to false in the same transaction.
Object storage keys and policy

raw-files/{file_hash} (content-addressed raw files)
outputs/{output_id}.parquet
repro-cartridges/{output_id}.zip
Upload-first pattern; orphan objects are GC candidates (future job).
Receipts

Include per-file reports with parser_attempts and first_error_line when available.
Include ingestion_summary totals.
Include pipeline summary (status, row_count, error if any).
Testing guidance

Unit tests for each component live in crates/sapflux-core/tests/.
Transactions integration test requires SAPFLUX_TEST_DATABASE_URL; skips otherwise.
Prefer tests to understand intended behavior and column names.
Planning docs map (optional reading)

planning/plan.md: high-level implementation plan.
planning/writeups/02_database_and_storage.md: DB + object store overview.
planning/writeups/03_transaction_workflow.md: transaction lifecycle and receipts.
planning/writeups/05_processing_and_calculations.md: pipeline stage order and roles.
planning/writeups/09_cartridge.md: reproducibility cartridge goals and contents.
planning/notes/*.md: topic deep-dives (read only if needed).
planning/reference_implementations/**: reference-only; do not rely on these over code.
How to keep this index evergreen without edits

For current status/tasks: open the highest-numbered file in:
progress_report/ for the latest statusX.md.
code_reviews/ for the latest N_*.md.
This index only points to locations; you can append new reports/reviews without modifying this file.
Lightweight prompt recipe (to keep tokens small)

Always include:
crates/** and migrations/0001_init.sql
planning/agent_index.md
Only when needed:
Highest-numbered progress_report/statusX.md
Highest-numbered code_reviews/N_*.md
One or two writeups for background (02/03/05), not the whole planning folder.
Common conventions

Columns:
logger_id is canonical and stable per file; parsers enforce single-ID invariant.
timestamp_utc is timezone-aware UTC.
parameter_* columns include parameter_source_* provenance.
Quality outputs: quality and quality_explanation (pipe-delimited reasons).
Grouping and dedup:
Timestamp fixer dedupes by (logger_id, record) across files and uses a sorted file_set_signature to define implied visits.
If you need “what’s next”
Read the latest code review and latest progress report per the rules above.
