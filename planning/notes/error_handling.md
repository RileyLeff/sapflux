We strongly prefer a structured error handling library like thiserror. This means that functions should return specific, typed errors (e.g., ParserError::InvalidHeader, TransactionError::IntegrityViolation) rather than generic strings, which makes the code more robust and easier to debug. Using something like anyhow is ok for binary code like a CLI, but the errors returned should be informative.
