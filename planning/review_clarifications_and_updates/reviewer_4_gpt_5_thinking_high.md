You’re very close. Most reviewer feedback has been incorporated and the plan is coherent. I’d green‑light after fixing a handful of inconsistencies and one design bug around object-store “atomicity.” See the gating items below.

What’s incorporated well

Parser strictness and invariants:
Reject any invalid SDI‑12 address and any non‑sequential record (strict +1). Implemented in reference parsers.
logger_id normalization: derive from header when missing; enforce single ID per file. Implemented.
Parsers extract all columns, not just those needed today. Documented.
Timestamp chunking:
The “implied visit” grouping by (logger_id, sorted set of file_hashes per record) is documented with a reference implementation.
Transactions:
Single entry point POST /transactions; preflight validation; serialized execution; “partial success” receipts; dry_run returns a full receipt but does not insert a transaction row. All documented.
Parameter storage and provenance:
parameter_overrides.value is JSONB, and parameter provenance is included in outputs.
Processing pipeline:
Sequence clarified and consistent: timestamp fix → metadata enrichment → parameter resolution → calculation → quality filters.
Security and downloads:
Clerk everywhere; pre‑signed URLs for outputs; GUI assets fetched via authenticated API with pre‑signed URLs.
Hosting:
Caddy with DNS‑01 via Cloudflare plugin (or Cloudflare origin certs) noted.
Remaining issues and fixes before implementation

“Atomic” object-store writes in the transaction workflow (must fix)
Issue: 03_transaction_workflow.md says raw file upload to R2 happens “as part of the same database transaction.” That’s not possible—object storage isn’t transactional with Postgres.
Fix:
For raw files: compute blake3, check R2 for key raw-files/{hash}. If missing, upload first (idempotent). Then start the DB tx and insert raw_files referencing that hash. If the DB tx fails afterward, the object is an orphan but harmless because future runs will dedupe by hash. Optionally, add a periodic garbage collector to delete objects not referenced in DB.
For outputs and cartridges: write object(s) first with deterministic keys (outputs/{uuid}.parquet, repro-cartridges/{uuid}.zip), then insert DB records in a tx; if the DB tx fails, the objects are orphans (optional GC). Do not claim DB atomicity with the bucket.
2. Deployment overlap at boundary not enforced by DB (should fix)

Current: deployments use a [) active_during range and an EXCLUDE … WITH && (overlap) constraint. Two periods that touch (end == start) are allowed by the DB and only rejected in “manifest validation.” Reviewer 3 and your reply said to enforce by constraints.
Fix (PostgreSQL): Keep the existing && exclusion to prevent overlaps, and add a second exclusion to prevent adjacency using the -|- operator:
EXCLUDE USING gist (datalogger_id WITH =, sdi_address WITH =, active_during WITH -|-) to disallow “touching” ranges.
You already added the equivalent alias constraint for datalogger_aliases; apply the same adjacency rule there if you also want to disallow back-to-back alias windows.
3. Reproducibility Cartridge vs. private R2 (inconsistency; choose one)

09_cartridge.md says download_data.sh fetches raw files from a public R2 bucket. Elsewhere you’ve committed to keeping R2 private with pre‑signed URLs.
Fix one of:
Keep R2 private: make download_data.sh call your API to get pre‑signed URLs for each file_hash listed in raw_files.manifest (requires auth).
Or, designate a public “raw-files/” bucket strictly for raw file objects and keep everything else private (simpler cartridge UX, different security stance).
Document the choice.
4. Flattening step is underspecified (should fix)

Your format is hierarchical (logger.df + nested sensors/thermistor pairs), but all downstream pipeline steps assume a single wide DataFrame with per‑thermistor-pair observations.
Add “Step 0: Flatten” to 05_processing_and_calculations.md:
One row per (timestamp, record, logger_id, sdi12_address, thermistor_depth).
Include logger-level columns and join the appropriate thermistor pair metrics (alpha, beta, time_to_max*, etc.).
This aligns with notes/data_column_conventions.md and makes the subsequent steps unambiguous.
5. Concurrency model statement mismatch (minor)

Reviewer log says “single instance, in‑process mutex.” The current workflow document uses a DB advisory lock. The latter is better and future‑proof.
Action: Keep the advisory lock and state it explicitly as the mechanism (it already is in 03_transaction_workflow.md).
6. Quality parameter naming vs. “parameter_*” convention (minor)

You use parameter_* columns for calculation parameters, but quality thresholds are named quality_* (without the prefix) and are also resolved via the cascade. That’s fine—just clarify in the parameter resolver doc that not all resolved parameters are emitted with “parameter_” prefixes; quality_* are emitted as-is with matching parameter_source_quality_* provenance.
7. is_latest semantics (nice to clarify)

outputs.is_latest exists but update policy isn’t documented.
If there is truly a single, global output stream, specify that insertion of a new outputs row sets is_latest = true and flips all others to false in the same DB tx.
8. Reference parser header/unit validation is brittle (non-blocking)

The reference code expects exact column counts/orders for SapFlowAll units/characteristics. Production code should make this pattern-based to handle different sensor counts and program variants. You’ve acknowledged this; just ensure it’s captured in your implementation plan.
9. Cartridge: clarify the trust boundary and data needed to reproduce (minor)

State that the cartridge’s run_repro.sh requires internet access (if you keep R2 private) or that raw files are publicly fetchable. Also note any CLI auth step if using pre‑signed URLs.
Tiny nits you can fix opportunistically

04_ingestion_and_data_formats.md still shows an older ParsedFileData example; you’ve already standardized on including file_hash—update the doc for consistency.
06_cli_and_api_reference.md is already updated to pre‑signed URLs for outputs; good. Ensure assets follow the same pattern or an authenticated proxy.
Make explicit in 03_transaction_workflow.md that “active parsers” and “active pipelines” come from DB flags, but the code is compiled-in (you already say this elsewhere).
Answering your three questions

Have all reviewer feedback been incorporated and questions addressed?
Largely yes. The major points from Reviewers 1–3 are reflected in the current documents. The main exceptions are:
The object-store/DB “same transaction” claim (must fix).
Deployment boundary adjacency enforcement is in prose but not in DB constraints (should fix).
Cartridge public/private inconsistency (decide and amend).
Add the explicit “flattening step” to the pipeline document.
2. Any inconsistencies within the docs or between docs and reviewer intents?

Yes, the three above are the meaningful ones. Minor naming and explanatory inconsistencies are noted but not blocking.
3. Is this plan ready to implement?

Almost. Resolve the gating items:
Reword the transaction/object-store atomicity section and adopt an idempotent, two‑phase approach (plus optional GC).
Add the adjacency exclusion constraint (or document why you’re keeping adjacency allowed if that’s your intent).
Decide and document cartridge download security (private with pre‑signed via API vs. public bucket).
Add Step 0: Flatten to the processing doc.
With those addressed, you’re good to implement.
Concise implementation checklist (edits to make)

03_transaction_workflow.md:
Replace “uploaded to object storage as part of the same database transaction” with the idempotent two‑phase approach; note orphan handling/GC.
02_database_and_storage.md:
Add EXCLUDE USING gist … active_during WITH -|- to deployments (and to datalogger_aliases if you also forbid alias adjacency).
05_processing_and_calculations.md:
Add “Step 0: Flatten hierarchical ParsedFileData into a single observation frame.”
Clarify parameter resolver output naming for quality_* columns and provenance.
09_cartridge.md:
Replace “public R2” wording with your chosen download method (API pre‑signed URLs or public bucket).
Note auth requirements (if any) and internet dependency.
04_ingestion_and_data_formats.md:
Ensure ParsedFileData includes file_hash in the example.
Optional future-hardening:
Add a periodic GC process to remove orphaned R2 objects not referenced in DB.
Document is_latest flipping logic in outputs.
If you make those few edits, I would consider the plan clean, consistent, and ready to build.
