Close to ready. You’ve addressed nearly all prior review points, and the docs are now largely consistent. Key fixes I see incorporated:

Object-store atomicity: 03_transaction_workflow now uses an idempotent “upload first, then DB” pattern and documents orphan GC. Good.
Deployment disambiguation: 02_database_and_storage adds EXCLUDE … WITH && and WITH -|- on deployments and aliases to reject overlaps and touching windows. Good.
Cartridge privacy: 09_cartridge pivots to private R2 with API-issued pre‑signed URLs via download_data.sh. Good.
Flattening: 05_processing_and_calculations adds Step 0 to flatten the hierarchical parse into one observation per thermistor pair. Good.
Dry runs: explicitly no DB writes, receipt via logs. Good.
“Latest” output: explicit policy to set new output is_latest=true and flip others to false in the same tx. Good.
Parameter overrides: JSONB value; quality thresholds and provenance naming clarified. Good.
Logger ID, SDI‑12 strictness, record +1 checks: enforced in the reference parsers. Good.
Pre‑signed URLs documented for outputs and assets. Good.
TLS with DNS‑01 via Caddy Cloudflare plugin documented. Good.
One substantive inconsistency to fix (blocking)

Batch vs single‑file processing for timestamp correction:
Your timestamp_fixer reference explicitly combines all accepted files for a run to deduplicate by (logger_id, record) and compute file‑set signatures. That requires visibility across the whole batch.
The ProcessingPipeline trait in 05 still takes a single ParsedData and the pseudocode runs timestamp_fixer on a single flattened DataFrame. That loses cross‑file deduplication and the core “implied visit” logic.
Fix one of:
Change the pipeline boundary to operate on a batch: e.g., Orchestrator collects all accepted ParsedFileData for the run, then calls pipeline.run_batch(&ExecutionContext, &[Box<dyn ParsedData>]) and passes them to the timestamp_fixer; or
Keep timestamp_fixer as an orchestrator pre-step that ingests the full slice of ParsedFileData, returns one combined, corrected DataFrame, and then call a calculation/quality pipeline on that frame (i.e., change pipeline.run to accept a DataFrame instead of a single ParsedData).
Also align the function signature in 05 with the reference timestamp_fixer (which currently accepts &[ParsedFileData]) or document the exact combining step in the orchestrator.
Minor nits (non‑blocking, but worth tightening)

Parser trait naming: 04_ingestion shows SapflowParser::code_identifier(); the reference code uses name(). Not harmful, but align the docs or add a note that the reference is illustrative.
Reference parser header/unit validation is still positionally strict; you already mark it as an old/reference impl. If you keep it, note in 04_ingestion that production parsers should use pattern-based validation to tolerate program variants.
Small formatting glitches in 02 (a closing ``` in a SQL block) — purely cosmetic.
Consider explicitly stating in 02 or 05 that outputs/cartridges follow the same “object first, then DB record” pattern as raw files (you’ve done this for raw files and generally for object lifecycle; mirroring it for outputs avoids ambiguity).
Bottom line

After you resolve the batch vs single‑file pipeline boundary for timestamp correction (the only material inconsistency), the plan is ready to implement.
Everything else looks consistent with prior reviewer intent and your responses.
Quick edit checklist

Update 05_processing_and_calculations (and/or the orchestrator section) to:
Define where and how all accepted ParsedFileData for the run are combined.
Ensure timestamp_fixer operates on the full batch (so file_set_signature logic is correct).
Adjust the pipeline trait or document an orchestrator pre-step that produces one combined frame.
Optionally align SapflowParser trait naming in 04_ingestion with the reference code or add a note.
Optionally add a sentence in 02 or 03/05 that outputs/cartridges follow the same non-transactional object-store write pattern with orphan-safe GC.
