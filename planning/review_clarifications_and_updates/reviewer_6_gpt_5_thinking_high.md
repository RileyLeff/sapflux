Almost there—green light with one small but important correction before you start coding.

What looks good

Batch processing: 05 now defines ProcessingPipeline::run_batch(...) and the orchestrator passes the full file set; timestamp fixing and dedup happen inside the pipeline. Great.
Transaction workflow: 03 explicitly says the batch pipeline runs after metadata succeeds. Good.
DB/storage: 02 adds -|- adjacency constraints, fixes fences, documents is_latest flipping, and applies the “upload-first + GC” pattern to raw files and outputs/cartridges. Good.
Ingestion/docs: 04 clarifies trait identifier naming, ParsedFileData includes file_hash. Good.
Pre-signed URLs and private R2 are reflected in 06 and 09. Good.
Flattening step documented in 05. Good.
One blocker to fix (FK ordering)

raw_files.ingesting_transaction_id REFERENCES transactions(transaction_id) and is NOT NULL. In 03 you currently insert the transactions row only after the mutating phase commits (“inserted in autocommit mode on success/failure”). That will violate the FK when inserting raw_files during the main DB transaction, because the referenced transactions row doesn’t exist yet.
Simple fix (common pattern):
Generate transaction_id at the start.
Insert a transactions row immediately (autocommit) with outcome = "PENDING" (and maybe a minimal stub receipt).
Run the mutating phase in a DB transaction, inserting raw_files with that transaction_id.
On success/failure, update the existing transactions row (outcome = ACCEPTED/REJECTED, receipt = final JSON).
Dry runs: don’t create a transactions row at all (as you already state).
Alternatively, drop the FK or make it nullable, but the “PENDING then UPDATE outcome” approach is cleaner and keeps the audit link intact.
Nice-to-have (non-blocking)

In 04/README for parsers, add a line that production validation should be pattern-based (not positionally fixed) so program variants aren’t rejected; keep the current tests as fixtures only.
If you make the FK ordering change above, I’d start implementation.
