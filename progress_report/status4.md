# Sapflux Pipeline Progress Report (Update 4)

## Highlights Since Last Update
- Implemented a reusable ingestion engine that hashes incoming files, skips duplicates, and runs them through the registered parser stack while collecting detailed reports (success, duplicate, failure with attempt logs).
- Added regression tests covering ingestion success and duplicate detection using the existing SapFlowAll fixtures.
- Parameter cascade and metadata enrichment are now wired into the `standard_v1_dst_fix` pipeline, giving a fully timestamp-corrected, metadata-enriched, parameter-resolved observation frame ready for calculations.

## Current State
- `cargo test` passes across the workspace; the DB seeding test still auto-skips without `SAPFLUX_TEST_DATABASE_URL`.
- Ingestion returns `ParsedFile` batches + reports; parameter resolver, metadata enrichment, and flattening/timestamp fixing already integrated.
- CLI/db-seed tooling is in place; API/transaction orchestration and downstream calculations are still pending.

## Next Focus
1. Wire the ingestion engine into a CLI/API pathway (e.g., `sapflux ingest` or transaction handler stub) to prep for full transaction flow.
2. Implement calculation & quality stages and hook them into the pipeline.
3. Stand up the Axum API (health + transactions) so the CLI can exercise end-to-end ingestion and seeding through the server.
