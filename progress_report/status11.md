# Sapflux Pipeline Progress Report (Update 11)

## Highlights Since Last Update
- Enriched `TransactionReceipt` with a `quality_summary` (row totals, suspect counts, and top quality reasons) and a `provenance_summary` that bubbles up the most common non-default parameter overrides to aid triage.
- Hardened the pipeline regression test to assert duplicate collapse across overlapping files, including signature consistency and paired-row expectations for each thermistor channel.
- Added calculator edge-case coverage for the Tmax branch, verifying both the `tm <= heat_pulse` guard and the negative discriminant path return `None` without NaNs.
- Extended the `/transactions` integration test to validate the new receipt diagnostics in both dry-run and committed flows.

## Next Focus
1. Implement the R2/S3 object store backend with upload-first semantics plus a dry-run GC sketch for orphaned blobs.
2. Surface richer receipt diagnostics (e.g., pipeline provenance samples or suspect breakdowns) if additional hooks prove useful once storage lands.
3. Begin wiring output parquet emission and the reproducibility cartridge once the object store supports real uploads.
4. Expand integration coverage around overlapping-file commits and alias resolution once the new storage path is stable.
