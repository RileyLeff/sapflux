# Sapflux Pipeline Progress Report (Update 15)

## Highlights Since Last Update
- Implemented TOML-based metadata manifests with preflight validation and transactional apply, allowing deployments and parameter overrides to be ingested alongside raw files.
- Switched `/transactions` to a streaming multipart handler (manifest + files), setting the stage for large-batch uploads without base64 overhead.
- Receipts now include optional `metadata_summary` and artifact keys, and a new download endpoint returns presigned URLs for parquet or cartridge outputs.

## Next Focus
1. Docker-compose harness (Postgres + MinIO + API) plus smoke script to exercise the full multipart → pipeline → publish → download loop locally.
2. Build out richer integration coverage for the new manifest/multipart path and ensure the GC tooling handles real uploads.
3. (Soon after) continue with multipart optimisations and deterministic output guardrails as part of the full end-to-end milestone.
