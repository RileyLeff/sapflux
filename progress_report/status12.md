# Sapflux Pipeline Progress Report (Update 12)

## Highlights Since Last Update
- Added an S3/R2-compatible object store backend with full upload-first semantics, presigned GET support, and env-based configuration capable of targeting local MinIO as well as Cloudflare R2.
- Implemented object-store listing/deletion helpers and a GC planner that diffs store contents against database references for raw files, outputs, and reproducibility cartridges.
- Extended the `sapflux-admin` CLI with an `object-store-gc` command that reports orphaned keys and optionally applies deletions to keep the store tidy.
- Wired the GC module into the core library behind the runtime feature flag so services and tooling share a single implementation.

## Next Focus
1. Enhance transaction receipts/tests to surface richer pipeline diagnostics now that storage plumbing is in place.
2. Exercise the new S3 backend end-to-end with MinIO/R2 smoke tests, including presigned URL validation.
3. Begin output parquet + reproducibility cartridge wiring atop the new object store capabilities.
4. Follow up with automatic or scheduled GC workflows once dry-run reporting proves stable.
