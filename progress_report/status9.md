# Sapflux Pipeline Progress Report (Update 9)

## Highlights Since Last Update
- Added an advisory lock around `execute_transaction` so manifest processing is serialized at the database level.
- Wired the object store to read configuration from the environment and log its active mode, keeping the filesystem-backed store usable for dev while preparing for real R2 integration.
- Enriched ingestion receipts with parser attempt details, first error line numbers, and per-batch summaries (total/parsed/duplicates/failed) to accelerate triage.
- Hardened metadata enrichment with explicit ambiguity guards for deployments and aliases, turning data misconfiguration into clear errors.
- Documented that the reference parsers' header validations are intentionally strict and should evolve to pattern-based matching in production.
- Landed two integration tests: a batch pipeline test that asserts file-set signatures survive deduplication, and a `/transactions` flow test (behind the DB env guard) that exercises dry-run vs commit semantics end-to-end.

## Next Focus
1. Implement the calculation and quality-filter components inside `standard_v1_dst_fix`, including provenance columns and receipt exposure.
2. Introduce a real R2/S3 object store client alongside the filesystem backend, with upload-first semantics and a GC stub for orphaned blobs.
3. Surface richer diagnostics in transaction receipts (row counts, parameter provenance snapshots) once the calculator is active.
4. Start plumbing reproducibility output generation (output parquet + cartridge) after the calculator/quality stages land.
