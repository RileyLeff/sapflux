# Sapflux Pipeline Progress Report

## Summary
- Established a multi-crate Rust workspace (`sapflux-core`, `sapflux`, `sapflux-admin`, `sapflux-parser`).
- Ported the reference parser implementation into `sapflux-parser` and wired it into `sapflux-core` registries.
- Added canonical registry descriptors (data format, parsers, pipeline) and shared seeding logic that populates the database tables idempotently.
- Extended CLI binaries with `migrate`/`db-seed` commands that reuse the shared migration/seed helpers.
- Captured the full database schema in migrations (constraints, exclusions) and wrote smoke tests verifying registry population and seeding when a test database URL is provided.

## Current Status
- `cargo test` succeeds (DB seeding test auto-skips unless `SAPFLUX_TEST_DATABASE_URL` is set).
- Parser crates include strict validation and fixtures from the planning reference, ready for integration with ingestion.
- API server (`sapflux serve`) remains a stub; next milestones include implementing ingestion orchestration, timestamp fixer pipeline, and Axum routes.

## Next Focus
- Flesh out the processing pipeline (flattening, timestamp fixer integration, enrichment, calculation).
- Implement transaction ingestion workflow and database repositories.
- Stand up the Axum API skeleton with health and transaction endpoints.
