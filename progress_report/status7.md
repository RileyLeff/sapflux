# Sapflux Pipeline Progress Report (Update 7)

## Highlights Since Last Update
- Introduced a pluggable object-store abstraction (currently a no-op stub) and routed the transaction workflow through it so raw-file uploads happen before `raw_files` persistence.
- Updated `/transactions` API to return full JSON receipts with pipeline status and ingestion reports while keeping the endpoint fully asynchronous.
- Added serialization support for ingestion reports, enabling richer per-file insights in receipts.
- Ensured all changes compile and pass the existing test suite (`cargo test`).

## Current State
- Transactions now mirror the intended lifecycle: PENDING row insertion, ingestion, store uploads (stub), pipeline evaluation, receipt persistence, and raw-file commits on success.
- Execution context loading, alias-aware enrichment, and canonical parameter defaults remain in place from earlier updates.

## Next Focus
1. Replace the no-op object store with real upload logic (configurable S3/R2 client) and handle error propagation/GC for orphaned uploads.
2. Implement the calculator + quality stages in `standard_v1_dst_fix`, surfacing their outputs and flags in receipts.
3. Expand receipts with row counts, parser attempt summaries, and pre-work for reproducibility cartridges.
