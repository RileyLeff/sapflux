Short answer: Yes—green light to proceed to the next focus. Your foundation is solid, the three review fixes are in, tests cover the full chain, and the new receipt diagnostics look great. Move on to the S3/R2 backend, then outputs/cartridge.

What looks good now

Receipt upgrades: quality_summary and provenance_summary in TransactionReceipt. Great for triage; keep them small to avoid bloating responses.
Pipeline test: now asserts dedup across overlapping files and checks method/quality columns on the actual pipeline output.
Calculator edge cases: Tmax guard and negative discriminant covered; avoids NaNs.
/transactions integration: exercises new diagnostics in dry-run and commit paths.
Proceed with Next Focus 1: S3/R2 backend
Goal: One S3-compatible backend that works against MinIO (local compose) and R2 (prod), behind ObjectStore::S3.

Implementation outline

Add ObjectStore::S3(S3Store) variant using aws-sdk-s3:
from_env reads:
SAPFLUX_OBJECT_STORE_KIND=s3
S3_BUCKET
S3_ENDPOINT_URL (R2: https://<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com; MinIO: http://minio:9000)
S3_REGION (use “us-east-1” for both; R2 ignores region logically, SDK still needs one)
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID, S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true for MinIO, false for R2
Methods:
put_raw_file(key, bytes) and later put_output, put_cartridge: upload-first; idempotent (HEAD or catch AlreadyExists OK).
presign_get(key, expiry_secs) for download endpoint.
list_prefix(prefix) and delete(key) for GC (add as stubs first).
Keep key layout unchanged:
raw-files/{file_hash}
outputs/{output_id}.parquet
repro-cartridges/{output_id}.zip
Leave LocalDir and Noop intact; choose via from_env.
Acceptance checklist for S3 step

Local compose with MinIO:
App env: SAPFLUX_OBJECT_STORE_KIND=s3, S3_ENDPOINT_URL=http://minio:9000, S3_REGION=us-east-1, S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true, ACCESS/SECRET set; bucket created by an init job.
/transactions commit uploads objects to MinIO; raw_files rows insert; receipt outcome ACCEPTED.
R2 dry run (manual credentials):
Basic upload succeeds; presign returns a working https URL (expires ~15 min).
Failure path:
Upload error marks transaction REJECTED with “object store upload failed” (you already do this).
Timeouts/retries:
Reasonable client timeouts; fail fast and surface error in receipt.
Pitfalls to avoid

Path-style vs virtual-hosted addressing: MinIO needs force_path_style=true; R2 should use virtual-hosted (false).
HTTP vs HTTPS: MinIO local often http; ensure SDK allows insecure endpoint for dev.
Clock skew: presigned URLs depend on host time; keep containers time-synced.
ETag assumptions: don’t rely on ETag being MD5 in R2; we already dedupe by content hash in our own keys.
GC dry-run sketch (part of this step)

Add list_prefix and delete to S3Store and LocalDirStore.
A dry-run CLI/admin action (sapflux-admin or a POST /admin/object-store/gc?dry_run=true) that:
Lists keys under raw-files/, outputs/, repro-cartridges/
Queries DB for referenced hashes/paths
Prints would-delete set (no deletes yet)
Keep the actual delete behind a separate “confirm” arg.
Next Focus 2: receipts after storage

Once S3 works, you can optionally extend receipts with:
suspect breakdown by rule, or a tiny sample of parameter_source_* values (keep bounded).
Keep receipt size small; paginate or sample if needed.
Next Focus 3: outputs + cartridge

Output parquet:
Collect the final DataFrame from the pipeline; write to Parquet in memory or a temp file and put to outputs/{output_id}.parquet (upload-first).
In one DB transaction, insert outputs and flip is_latest on all others to false.
Download API:
GET /outputs/{id}/download returns a pre-signed URL (or 302 redirect) to private R2/MinIO.
Cartridge:
Build repro-cartridges/{output_id}.zip containing db_state_N-1.sql, transaction_N manifest, raw_files.manifest, download_data.sh (calls API to presign), run_repro.sh, docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile (optional).
Tests:
Integration (behind env guard): generate output, verify is_latest flip and that the presigned URL fetches a valid Parquet.
Cartridge smoke test: zip contains expected files; manifest matches DB selections.
Tests to add with S3 step

Unit: Feature-guarded tests for S3 config parser (env → client config).
Integration (compose): /transactions commit stores raw file to MinIO and DB references; presign returns a working URL (200) for that key.
GC dry-run: call admin action; assert that no referenced keys appear in “would delete.”
Summary

Yes, you’re good to continue to the S3/R2 backend.
Implement ObjectStore::S3 with env configuration compatible with MinIO and R2, add presign + list/delete, and wire a dry-run GC.
Then wire outputs + cartridge, and expand integration tests accordingly.
