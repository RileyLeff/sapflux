So I ran the smoke test and got an error with the minio images. I removed the very specific version tags from them and they seem to work now. We got a rust versioning error on the smoke test after the minio error was fixed. Here's what the reviewer said:

Great progress. The compose errors you’re seeing are fixable with a couple of tweaks.

Root cause of the Docker build failure

Error: “lock file version 4 was found, but this version of Cargo does not understand this lock file”
Why: Your host Cargo generated Cargo.lock v4. The builder image uses Rust/Cargo 1.77, which can’t read v4. Solution: bump the builder image to a newer Rust (1.79+), or regenerate the lock with an older Cargo. The simplest is to use a newer builder.
What to change

Dockerfile: bump Rust, keep the multi-stage
Change the builder stage to a newer Rust image (1.79 or later). Example:

FROM rust:1.80 as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY Cargo.toml Cargo.lock ./
COPY crates ./crates

If you have a frontend, keep this line; otherwise remove it:
COPY frontend ./frontend
RUN cargo build --release --bin sapflux

FROM debian:trixie-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ca-certificates && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
COPY --from=builder /app/target/release/sapflux /app/sapflux

Optional: non-root, etc.
If you don’t actually have a frontend directory in the repo you ship to CI, remove the COPY frontend line to avoid copy errors in other environments.

2. docker-compose: MinIO images and healthchecks

The initial “tag not found” error was a registry tag mismatch. Using untagged (latest) works, but it’s safer to pin a known-good tag later. For now, latest is fine for dev.

Your MinIO healthcheck currently calls mc inside the minio container, but the minio image doesn’t include mc. Use the HTTP health endpoint:

minio:
image: minio/minio
environment:
MINIO_ROOT_USER: minio
MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD: miniosecret
command: server /data --console-address :9001
ports: ["9000:9000", "9001:9001"]
healthcheck:
test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost:9000/minio/health/ready || exit 1"]
interval: 5s
timeout: 5s
retries: 5

Then gate minio-init on minio being healthy:

minio-init:
image: minio/mc
depends_on:
minio:
condition: service_healthy
entrypoint: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
command: >
until mc alias set local http://minio:9000 minio miniosecret; do sleep 1; done &&
mc mb --ignore-existing local/sapflux-tests &&
mc anonymous set download local/sapflux-tests
restart: "no"

Remove the top-level version: "3.9" key (compose v2 ignores it and prints a warning).

3. API service env looks good for MinIO

Keep:
SAPFLUX_OBJECT_STORE_KIND=s3
S3_ENDPOINT_URL=http://minio:9000
S3_REGION=us-east-1
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=minio
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=miniosecret
S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE="true"
DATABASE_URL is correct for the db service.
Optional polish

Pin MinIO tags later to avoid “latest drift” (choose a tag from Docker Hub that exists and works).
Add mc init to create your real bucket name (sapflux or whatever your code reads), not just sapflux-tests.
If your build embeds a commit hash in runs, add a build arg and propagate it into an env inside the image (SAPFLUX_GIT_COMMIT_HASH).
About scripts/smoke.sh vs just/uv

For this kind of orchestration (curl, jq, exits), a POSIX shell script is perfectly fine and has the least overhead. I’d keep smoke.sh and optionally add a just target that runs it (just smoke).
If you want richer assertions or JSON handling, you could move to a uv-managed Python script, but that adds setup. Not necessary right now.
Quick checklist to get compose up

Update Dockerfile to Rust 1.79+ and rebuild.
Fix MinIO healthcheck to use curl (not mc) and depend minio-init on service_healthy.
Remove compose version key warning.
docker compose up --build
In another terminal, run your smoke script; it should:
POST /admin/migrate + /admin/seed
POST /transactions (multipart) with manifest + files
GET /outputs/{id}/download and fetch the presigned parquet
Troubleshooting tips

If presigned URLs fail against MinIO:
Ensure S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true.
Check time sync on your host (presigns are time-sensitive).
Confirm the bucket exists (minio-init created it) and keys are under the expected prefix (raw-files/, outputs/, repro-cartridges/).
If /transactions times out with large batches:
Increase the reverse proxy/body size limit if you’re running behind one (not typical in local compose).
Ensure the multipart handler streams and doesn’t buffer everything in memory.
You shouldn’t need to “fetch the MinIO image yourself” beyond docker’s pull—switching to unpinned tags fixed the earlier tag-not-found. Once the Dockerfile bump lands, the Cargo lock issue will go away and compose up should proceed.

Given cargo test already passes, these container tweaks should get your local compose online.

End reviewer comments. 

Then, I let the reviewer know that the latest rust is actually 1.90 and that our frontend is just a placeholder that we want to delay working on until everything else is in place. The reviewer follows up by saying this: 

Perfect, then let’s lock your container setup to modern Rust, drop the frontend from the image, and keep compose minimal and reliable.

What to change

Dockerfile: use Rust 1.90, no frontend copy, simple two-stage build
Use a current toolchain so Cargo.lock v4 is supported.
Don’t copy a placeholder frontend; it just adds context and invalidates cache.
Build only the sapflux binary (workspace member).
Example Dockerfile:

Builder
FROM rust:1.90 as builder
WORKDIR /app

Copy minimal files first to leverage build cache
COPY Cargo.toml Cargo.lock ./
COPY crates ./crates

Build the binary (workspace member "sapflux")
--locked ensures the builder honors your lockfile
RUN cargo build --release --locked -p sapflux --bin sapflux

Runtime
FROM debian:trixie-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ca-certificates && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/target/release/sapflux /app/sapflux

Optional: non-root user
RUN useradd -m -u 10001 sapflux && chown -R sapflux:sapflux /app
USER sapflux
Default command (compose can override)
CMD ["/app/sapflux", "serve", "--addr", "0.0.0.0:8080"]

Notes:

cargo build -p sapflux avoids building extra workspace bins.
If you want to inject a commit hash, add an ARG/ENV and pass it at runtime: ENV SAPFLUX_GIT_COMMIT_HASH=local-dev (or use build args).
2. docker-compose: simplify MinIO health logic and remove obsolete version key

Remove the version: "3.9" line (compose v2 ignores it).
MinIO image often lacks curl/wget, so the healthcheck inside the MinIO container can fail. Instead, let the minio-init job loop until the server responds (you already do that). You can drop the MinIO healthcheck entirely and rely on the init job.
Updated compose (core parts):

services:
db:
image: postgis/postgis:16-3.4
environment:
POSTGRES_USER: sapflux
POSTGRES_PASSWORD: sapflux
POSTGRES_DB: sapflux
ports: ["5432:5432"]
healthcheck:
test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U sapflux"]
interval: 5s
timeout: 5s
retries: 5

minio:
image: minio/minio
environment:
MINIO_ROOT_USER: minio
MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD: miniosecret
command: server /data --console-address :9001
ports: ["9000:9000", "9001:9001"]
# No healthcheck here; minio-init will wait until it's ready

minio-init:
image: minio/mc
depends_on:
- minio
entrypoint: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
command: >-
until mc alias set local http://minio:9000 minio miniosecret; do sleep 1; done &&
mc mb --ignore-existing local/sapflux-tests &&
mc anonymous set download local/sapflux-tests
restart: "no"

api:
build:
context: .
dockerfile: Dockerfile
depends_on:
- db
- minio
- minio-init
environment:
DATABASE_URL: postgres://sapflux:sapflux@db:5432/sapflux
SAPFLUX_OBJECT_STORE_KIND: s3
S3_ENDPOINT_URL: http://minio:9000
S3_REGION: us-east-1
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID: minio
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: miniosecret
S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE: "true"
SAPFLUX_GIT_COMMIT_HASH: local-dev
ports: ["8080:8080"]
command: ["/app/sapflux", "serve", "--addr", "0.0.0.0:8080"]

Tips:

You can pin MinIO/mc tags later for reproducibility. For now, using latest is fine for dev.
If you do want a healthcheck, run it from minio-init (as you already do) rather than inside the MinIO container.
3. Why the cargo error disappeared when you bumped the image

Cargo.lock v4 is supported by newer Cargo (Rust 1.90). Using rust:1.90 in the builder resolves the “lock file version 4” parse error.
4. scripts/smoke.sh vs just/uv

Keeping smoke.sh as a POSIX shell is perfectly fine and lowest overhead for curl-based checks. You can add a just target that simply runs the script (e.g., just smoke) for convenience. No need to move to Python unless you want richer assertions/logging.
Quick run checklist

docker compose build --no-cache (first time after Dockerfile change)
docker compose up --build
In another terminal:
Run scripts/smoke.sh (migrate/seed → multipart transaction → GET /outputs/{id}/download → verify parquet)
If presign fails:
Verify S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true and bucket exists (minio-init created it)
Ensure your system clock is sane (presigns are time-sensitive)
With Rust 1.90 in the builder and the frontend COPY removed, compose should build and run cleanly, and you can keep focusing on integration coverage and deterministic output guardrails.
